The platform was built in partnership with James Cropper's [Creative Minds](https://creativeminds.art/) franchise business. We created a two-sided marketplace where artists could both book existing art events and publish their own events for others to attend.

Unfortunately, the project didn't take off and was discontinued. A few takeaways:

- Building a two-sided marketplace business was much more complex than we initially thought, especially when it is bootstrapped.
- Time to market was was against us because we were launching it in the middle of a pandemic.
- We didn't have a clear understanding of the market and the needs of the artists and the event organisers.

## Technologies used:

- Next, Chakra UI, React Native
