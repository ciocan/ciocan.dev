The project came alive from hundreds of photographs taken in London in the year of 2015. 

When I moved to London in 2015, I was fascinated by the city and the people. I was interested in street photography for some time and London was the perfect place to do it.

After a few years of taking photos, I started to notice that people were looking at their phones more and more. I was curious to see how this would change the way people interact with the city and the world around them.

I started to share my photos on social media and I was surprised to see how many people were interested in the project.

I decided to organise an exhibition of my photos in 2019 and I called it #SCREENTIME.
